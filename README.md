# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of various data structures and algorithms, including arrays, sorting techniques, and linked lists. Each implementation is organized into specific categories for better understanding and ease of navigation.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Array**
- Basic operations and manipulation of arrays.

### 2. **Simple Sorting Algorithms**
- **Selection Sort**: A straightforward algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
- **Bubble Sort**: An iterative algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

### 3. **Advanced Sorting Algorithms**
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the results.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.

### 4. **Linked List**
- **Simple Linked List**: A basic linked list where each node points to the next.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first, forming a circle.
